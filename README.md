# General mechanisms of task engagement in the primate frontal cortex
This repository contains data and MATLAB code to reproduce the main figures and analyses in:

Grohn J, Khalighinejad N, Jahn C, Bongioanni A, Schuffelgen U, Sallet J, Rushworth M, and Kolling N. General mechanisms of task engagement in the primate frontal cortex. Nature Communications.

The `make_figures.m` script loads in behavioural and neural data and creates the various figures. To plot the 3d maps of neural activity, files in the `maps` folder can be loaded in and viewed with software such as [FSLeyes](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLeyes).
